            The two of them both had their own food accounts, and eventually met
            through their love of food. Nathan owns the instgram bokehbites and Pearl 
            owns pearlthefoodie. I compiled some of the photos they shot and created a 
            short review of the resturants/food they tried. I really like their feed, their 
            style, and the story they create.  <br/>

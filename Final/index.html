                    Sistar was a South Korean girl group formed by Starship Entertainment. The group consists 
                    of Bora, Hyolyn, Soyou, and Dasom. The group debuted in 2010 with the song Push Push. 
                    During the middle of their 'Let's Start Sharing Concert' performance, Bora suddenly fell on
                    stage, fracturing her thumb. After the injury was dealt with, the members all returned back
                    on stage to finish their performance. A fan taken video of this performance went viral, and 
                    they received a lot of media attention. This jump started their career, leading to many hit
                    songs. Their image as a group was different from many others and because all of their songs
                    were summer hits, they became known as 'Queens of Summer'. It isn't summer until Sistar comes
                    back. Unfortuantely, as 7 years come to a close, they sent us off with their last song,
                    'Lonely'. While it is softer and sadder compared to their usual, upbeat songs, this video 
                    takes place at the end of a summer night, marking an end to a journey. While it was a sad goodbye, 
                    their disbandment was the most ideal compared to many others, and it gave fans hope that we will 
                    see them together again.

                    Dasom always had rumors about her bullying the rest of the group and 
                    being casted out. That's the perception. In the end, we get to see the
                    reality. Even when the rumors knocked her down, Sistar always defended
                    her and helped her get right back up.

                    Bora was always seen hanging out with people from other groups. The perception
                    was that she was also an outcast and that the other members didn't want to hang
                    out with her. But in reality, the girls were always behind her. They never left her 
                    side.

                    While Hyolyn and Soyou's solo careers took off, the perception was that the other
                    two members were left behind. In reality, they never fell out of the picture.

                    This can also be said for their subunit Sistar19. The point of them showing all of 
                    this was that it didn't matter what anyone else said, they knew the truth. They knew 
                    how strong their friendship was.

                    No matter what each member did individually, each summer, they came together to 
                    give us something special. And in the end, they put down their heels, signifying 
                    the end of their career.
